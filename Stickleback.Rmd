## Introduction

Sticklebacks are small freshwater and oceanic fish, characterised by
their abundance of small spines. *Gasterosteus aculeatus*, three-spined
sticklebacks, in conjunction with a species of tapeworm
(*Schistocephalus solidus*), comprise a robust model system for the
study host-parasite relationships (Jolles et al., 2020). This tapeworm
species is associated with increased energy demands and altered immune
responses of its host organism (Benesh & Kalbe, 2016). The biological
phenomenon of helminth parasitism is exhibited by this system, the
capacity for immune modulation to be enacted by a parasite on its host,
altering future susceptibility to parasite infection (Piecyk et al.,
2019). *Diplostomum pseudospathaceum*, a second parasitic worm species
(trematode), has been identified in a number of bird and fish species,
including sticklebacks. In this study we aim to identify how infection
with parasite A (*Schistocephalus solidus*), may bolster the immune
system of sticklebacks such that they exhibit a level of resistance to
infection with parasite B (*Diplostomum pseudospathaceum*). Three levels
of parasite A infection were measured; high-growth, low-growth and
presently uninfected (historical infection unknown). The control group
were never exposed to parasite A. The four groups were exposed to
parasite B with infection intensity measured. The primary hypothesis is
that a historical, cleared infection of parasite A will afford the
uninfected group greater protection from parasite B than the control
group. Conversely, current infection with parasite A will be detrimental
to the immune system of the sticklebacks, rendering them more
susceptible to infection with parasite B than the control group. The
secondary hypothesis concerns the energetic costs of parasite A on
sticklebacks, which may undermine its potential immunological benefits.
It is expected that sticklebacks exposed to high-growth parasite A will
have reduced body length from the control group, perhaps affecting one
sex more severely due to disparities in energy requirements during
reproduction.

## Analysis

Initially, I aimed to establish whether there was an immunological
advantage to infection of the host with a helminth parasite. To address
this question, parasite A (Control, Infected HG, Infected LG and
Uninfected) was compared with the log of parasite B intensity (right
eye + left eye + 1). I used an ordinary least squares method to analyse
parasite B intensity with parasite A treatment levels as the categorical
predictor, against the control. This model violated the assumption of
normality of residues, thus a square-root data transformation was
undertaken to improve the fit of the model to the data.

To establish the biological cost of parasite A on sticklebacks, each
treatment level was compared with initial stickleback length (mm), then
subdivided into length per sex to compare energetic cost. An ordinary
least squares method was employed to analyse treatment (parasite A) as
the predictor variable with length (mm). There was moderate violation of
linear model assumptions normality of residues, however, data
transformation did not improve this outcome, therefore, careful
consideration with which this model is applied to the wider population,
must be taken. A t-test was performed to directly compare the
categorical variable of sex with the continuous variable of length, to
establish biological connection.

R version 4.4.0 was used to undertake this analysis. Packages 'janitor'
and 'tidyverse' were used to clean the data, with 'dplyr' used to filter
the data. 'patchwork' and ggplot extension 'gghighlight' were used
construct the figures. 'gt' and gtExtras' were used to create table 1.
'rstatix' and 'lmtest' were used to undertake statistical tests with
'performance' used to measure violations of linear model assumptions.

## Results and Discussion

### Immunological impact of *Schistocephalus solidus* on *Gasterosteus aculeatus* susceptibility to *Diplostomum pseudospathaceum*

Hypothesis 1: Historical infection of sticklebacks with parasite A will
be of immunological advantage.

Hypothesis 2: Current infection of sticklebacks with parasite A will be
of immunological disadvantage.

**Figure 1. Historical infection of sticklebacks with parasite A reduces
infection level with parasite B, meanwhile, present infection with
parasite A increases infection level of sticklebacks with parasite B.**
Analysis of variance identified a mean decrease in parasite B intensity
of 0.17(95%CI;0.09:0.26) from the control group to the uninfected group,
whilst the infected HG group had a mean increase in parasite B intensity
of 0.17(95%CI;0.09:0.26). This aligns with the hypotheses that
historical infection may offer immunological advantage whilst current
infection may be weaken immune response to parasite B. Each colour
indicates a treatment: white; control, yellow; uninfected, orange;
low-growth infection, red; high-growth infection. The dashed lines
indicate the means of each group: black; control mean, blue; mean of
each of the three treatments.

The findings can be summarised as below (**Table 1**). The minimum,
maximum and mean parasite B intensity for each treatment, alongside
their relative distributions can be seen.

```

#### Statistical Analysis

The analysis showed that historical parasite A infection contributed to
a mean decrease of -0.16(95% CI;-0.25:-0.06) parasite B intensity from
the control, statistically significant at t~214~ = -3.08, *p* = 0.002.
Current infection of parasite A, however, showed sticklebacks with a
high-growth parasite A infection had a mean increased parasite B
intensity of a 0.17(95%CI;0.09:0.26) from the control group, with a mean
1.33 diplo intensity (95%CI;1.27:1.39). This was statistically
significant(t~214~ = 4.04, *p* = 0.0000732). Sticklebacks with a
low-growth parasite A strain infection, however, had a mean decreased
parasite B intensity of -0.08(95%CI;-0.19:0.04) from the control
sticklebacks which was not statistically significant (t~214~ = -1.27,
*p* = 0.21). A study comparing high-growth and low-growth parasite A
infection noted 23 key immune genes up-regulated during the infection at
a later time-point in response to high-growth compared with low-growth,
this delay in immune response consolidates the notion that the immunity
would initially be weakened in the high-growth group (Piecyk et al.,
2019). With *F*3,214= 17.02, *p* \<0.001, R^2^ 0.18, it is possible some
of the variance may be explained by other factors which could impact
intensity of parasite B such as the size or sex of the stickleback and
how these variables may have been impacted by treatments with parasite
A.

### Biological impact of *Schistocephalus solidus* on *Gasterosteus aculeatus*, measured by length and sex

Hypothesis 1: Infection of high-growth parasite A will decrease size of
sticklebacks.

Hypothesis 2: Energetic costs of parasite A infection will impact male
sticklebacks more severely.

A comparison of stickleback length (per parasite A treatment) and
stickleback length subdivided into male and female (**Figure 2**). Some
interesting observations can be made, including apparent increased
length for the low-growth A infected group, which also happens the be
the only group in which the mean length of male sticklebacks is greater
than the mean length of female sticklebacks. There does not appear to be
an apparent mean difference in length between the high-growth infected
group than the control and the impact of each treatment does not appear
to affect one sex more severely than another.

**Figure 2. The effect of parasite A treatment on the length of
sticklebacks, subdivided by sex.** An analysis of variance did not
identify a statistically significant relationship between treatment and
length. However, a relationship between length and sex was identified.
Each colour indicates a treatment: white; control, yellow; uninfected,
orange; low-growth infection, red; high-growth infection.

#### Statistical Analysis

An ordinary least squares method was used to analyse the impact of
treatment (parasite A) as the predictor variable as its effect on
length. The high-growth infection group, had a mean increase in length
of 0.02 mm(95%CI;-1.24:1.28) from the control sticklebacks (mean = 41.4
mm(95% CI;40.53:42.27)), however this was not statistically significant
(t~160~ = 0.03, *p* = 0.98). Sticklebacks with a low-growth parasite A
infection have a mean increase in length of 0.98 mm(95%CI;-0.55:2.52)
from the control which is not statistically significant (t~160~ = 1.27,
*p* = 0.21). Finally, the uninfected sticklebacks had a mean increase in
length of 0.15 mm(95% CI;-1.27:1.56) from the control which is also not
statistically significant (t~160~ = 0.20, *p* = 0.84). The model had an
R^2^ of 0.01 and an adjusted R^2^ of -0.01 conferring insignificance of
the explanatory variables. Not only are there no statistically
significant differences, the biological implication of an average of
0.02 mm difference in length as seen in the HG infected group would be
very limited.

A t-test was undertaken to determine whether some of the variance in
stickleback length could be determined by sex as the predictor variable.
The model identified an mean of -1.05 mm(95%CI;-2.03:-0.07) increase in
length of female stickleback, statistically significant at (t~161~ =
-2.12, *p* = 0.04). The R^2^ of 0.027 and adjusted R^2^ of 0.02, states
that just 2 % of the variance is explained by the model. We can
therefore suggest a relationship between sex and length which may be
unrelated to parasitism.

Whilst there did appear to be a significant difference observed between
the control and low-growth infection groups between the sexes, the small
sample size of the LG group must be considered, these data points were
overly-influential compared with other treatment groups.

## Conclusion

Overall, there appears an immunological benefit to sticklebacks able to
clear infection of parasite A in protection from parasite B and there is
little evidence to suggest an energetic cost associated with the initial
infection. Further study of the impact of parasite A infection of
reproduction, life expectancy and vulnerability to predation should be
studied, particularly conisdering harbouring parasites can make these
fish more vulnerable to predators, slowing their movement and response
time (Demandt et al., 2018). It could also be interesting to further
research whether competition between parasite A and B plays a role in
susceptibility and look more closely at the genetic differences in the
23 immune response genes.
