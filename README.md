Sticklebacks are a popular model organism for the study of host-parasite relationships. Here we identify the extent to which one common parasite can modulate the stickleback immune system to influence a response to a second parasite. 

## 📊 How to use:
 
The data can be found in the 'data' folder. Exploration was carried out in the explore_stickleback.R script and the code for the figures and linear models are located in the stickleback.R script.
